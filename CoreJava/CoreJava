1)  What is difference between throw and throws keyword?

The throw and throws keywords in Java are both related to exception handling but serve different purposes:

throw Keyword
The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception from a method or any block of code.
It is typically used to throw either a checked or unchecked exception, which must be an object of the Throwable class or its subclasses (e.g., Exception, RuntimeException, etc.).
After executing the throw statement, the execution stops and the exception is propagated up the call stack.

2)  Checked exception vs unchecked exception

Checked:  checked exception with out try and catch (or) throws keyword it will give compile time error-SQLException
Unchecked: compiler will not give error: ex: Arthematic Exception

3)  try ,catch and finally

4)  How does the try-with-resources statement work in Java?

5)  how to create custom exception,? what is the need of it..

6)  Can we catch multiple exceptions in a single catch block?

7)  What is the use of the finally block in exception handling?

8)  What happens if an exception is not caught in a method?

   The exception is propagated up the call stack to the previous method. If no method catches the exception, it ultimately reaches the JVM, which terminates the program.

9)  What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?
